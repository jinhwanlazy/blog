As a long time HHKB user, I feel like to have number of copies of the same
keyboard. One for Lab, one for home, one for carrying, etc..  However, as I am a poor student,
I don't have enough budget to do such a thing. What a rediculously expensive
keyboard!

I thought about making one myself. And It seemed to be able to reduce the cost 
under $100 by making hardwares using 3D printer. Most mechanical keyboards has
a metal plate made of aluminum or steel where switches fits in. Usually it
is the most expensive part if you try DIY. 
The key idea to make a cheap keyboard is to use 3D printed case itself as a
plate. The standard thickness of the plate, 1.5mm was too thin for PLA, So I had
to maximized it to 5mm and make some lips to reinforce it.

Acually, [I did it last year](https://github.com/jinhwanlazy/3d-printable-keyboard).
I designed it with [OpenJSCAD](https://openjscad.org/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinhwanlazy/3d-printable-keyboard/master/model.js)
, and printed it with my
[3DR-simple](http://trains.socha.com/2013/11/building-3dr-simple-delta-printer-part-i.html) copy.
I had to split it in 3 parts, due to size of the printer, and glued them. 
I used teensy as controller, and hand wired the switches. 
It worked perfectly. I used it for a while. Unfortunately, I started to hate its
ugliness, but also it was too tall and loud. I didn't expected gateron blue
switchs are that loud! So I decided to try just one more time.

I chose a walnut block this time rather than fused plastic so It looks gorgeous
but still kept the budget under $150 including keycaps.
[Max Keyboard](http://www.maxkeyboard.com/) made fully
printed set of keycaps with $50. 
[I've also designed the PCB myself](https://github.com/jinhwanlazy/hhkb-pcb),
because handwiring was too tedious.
