As a long time HHKB user, I felt like to have number of copies of the same
keyboard. One for Lab, one for home, etc..  However, as I am a poor student,
I didn't have enough money to buy another board.

I thought about making one myself. And It seemed to be able to reduce the cost 
under $100 by making hardwares using 3D printer. Most mechanical keyboards has
a metal plate made of aluminum or steel where switches fits in. And usually it
is the most expensive part if you try DIY. 
The key idea to make a cheap keyboard was to use 3D printed case itself as a
plate. So that I maximized plate thickness, and lip enforced overall stiffness.

I [did it](https://github.com/jinhwanlazy/3d-printable-keyboard) last year.
I designed it with [OpenJSCAD](https://openjscad.org/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinhwanlazy/3d-printable-keyboard/master/model.js)
, and printed it with my
[3DR-simple](http://trains.socha.com/2013/11/building-3dr-simple-delta-printer-part-i.html) copy.
I had to split it in 3 parts, due to size of the printer. And glued them. 
I used teensy as controller, and hand wired switches. 

It works perfectly. I used it for some times. Unfortunately, I started to hate its
ugliness, but also it was too tall and laud. I didn't expected gateron blue
switchs are so laud! So I decided to try just one more time. and this is the
result.

I chose a walnut block this time rather than fused plastic, but still kept the
budget under $150. [Max keyboard](http://www.maxkeyboard.com/)
made the keycaps for me.
