![My First 1000 race]({{ site.url }}/assets/typeracer-first1000.png)

This is the first 1000 race history of mine in typeracer.com.
Each dot represents score of each race.
Scores with high accuracy are expressed with denser color. 
They are grouped by date.
Red and blue lines are WPM and Accuracy of each date.

You will immediately notice some weird points, which is I have marked higher scores
when first few days than recent, and big ripple in accuracy in Feburary 12th to
16th.

For the first one, I have to admit that I had cheated. I was so exited to push 
my WPM **looks** higher, so I had done early quit when I was slow, and repeated 
with easy texts. I stopped it from January 20, and my average WPM have
improved from sub 80 to mid 80 since then.

Ripple in accuracy denotes my experiment to find how much I can be faster if I
try to be accurate. I was curious about the words **"Speed comes with accuracy"**,
which is the most common advice that you will get if you ask about how can you
be faster. I slowed down and foccused on not to make any mistake
as much as possible that days. 

It seemed work. It felt like stucked, but on the contrary average WPM was slightly increased on
But also I noticed that I cannot reach to my highest score with this strategy.
So I quit it. Next day, I tried push myself as fast as possible regardless of accuracy.
It was Feburary 17th, and I got the best average WPM of a day, 86.21 WPM.
So I can say that the advice is not quiet true.

The chart below shows it more obviously. It is a scatter plot of Accuracy vs
WPM. Datas are grouped by date and averaged. The number of games done in the day 
are shown next to each point.

There seems definitely a positive correlation between WPM and Accuracy, but
highest WPM seems to come from around 96% of accuracy.

I might be wrong, since I had only a limited number of data,
and I am still improving! I really want to see the chart of you guys,
have hundreds of thousands race history.
